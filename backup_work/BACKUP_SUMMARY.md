# Backup Summary - Question-Level Grading Implementation
Date: September 9, 2025

## Files Backed Up:

1. **QuestionSubmission.java** - Entity for individual question submissions
   - Location: `cscore-backend/src/main/java/iuh/fit/cscore_be/entity/`
   - Purpose: Stores individual question responses in assignments

2. **QuestionSubmissionRepository.java** - Data access layer
   - Location: `cscore-backend/src/main/java/iuh/fit/cscore_be/repository/`
   - Purpose: JPA repository for question submissions

3. **question_submissions_migration.sql** - Database schema
   - Location: `cscore-backend/`
   - Purpose: Creates question_submissions table and updates existing schema

4. **AutoGradingResponse.java** - DTO for grading responses
   - Location: `cscore-backend/src/main/java/iuh/fit/cscore_be/dto/response/`
   - Purpose: Response object for auto-grading operations

5. **StudentService_current.java** - Current service implementation
   - Location: `backup_work/`
   - Purpose: Working version of StudentService with basic submission handling

## Database Changes Applied:
- ✅ question_submissions table created
- ✅ test_results updated with question_submission_id
- ✅ submissions table updated with metadata fields

## Next Steps:
1. Restore working backend version
2. Re-apply these backed up files
3. Implement question-level grading gradually

## Key Features Implemented:
- Individual question submission handling
- Question-level test result tracking
- Auto-grading support for individual questions
